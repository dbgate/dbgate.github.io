title: Version 5.1.0 - Perspectives
categories: development

I am proud to announce new feature release with one big highlight - perspectives. Table perspectives feature is subset of visual query language defined by Eirik Bakke in his PhD work [PhD work](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ebakke/sieuferd/). It offers very comfortable and intuitive way to explore data in tables with complex relations. This feature works very well with foreign keys, but when you have database without foreign keys, you could define custom joins and define relations, which you need for the perspective.

<!--more--> 

It could even combine data from different databases or database servers into one report.

Please use [docs](/docs/perspectives) for further details.
