title: Version 4.5.0 - big electron app optimalization
categories: development
date:   2022-01-03 16:00:00
---

The main highlight of this release is under the hood of electron app. But there are also significant UX improvements.

## "Natural" tab order
Tabs in DbGate are ordered by database, to which the tab belongs. In new version, this paradigma is preserved, but user could reorder tabs with drag & drop. Tabs in database are ordered by opening time instead of alphabetical order. Also it is possible to drag all tabs belonging to one database.

## Improved column manager

There are several improvements of columns manager:
- Collapse left column in datagrid - removed from settings, remember last used state
- Ability to select multiple columns in column manager in datagrid + copy column names
- Show used filters in left datagrid column

## Electron app optimalization

In older version, electron app started HTTP server for API functions on random port. In new versions, these API functions are called directly by electron IPC. This way is much more effective and also safer, as nobody could connect to API.

Also there was standalone fork for API, now API lived in electron "main" process. This improves startup performance.
