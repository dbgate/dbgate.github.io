Today we accomplished important achievement - DbGate could be installed on Amazon web services.

Previously, to run the web version, you had to deploy Docker containers or install NPM packages on the server with DbGate, which required some configuration.

If you are familiar with Amazon web services, installing web version of DbGate is now task consisting of a few clicks. You have then available administration of users, connections and roles, and you could grant permissions for connections to some users.
