title: Version 4.8.0 - Redis support
categories: development
date:   2022-03-28 16:00:00

I am proud to announce new database engine supported in DbGate - Redis. Althought Redis is not very similar to SQL databases and MongoDB formerly supported by DbGate, integration of Redis is very intuitive and it uses the same principles as integration of other databases.

Supported Redis features:
* tree view for redis keys
* all basic key types (including streams)
* create, rename and remove keys
* edit key items or key content
* execute redis scripts
* generate script from redis key

## Explicit NDJSON support
NDJSON format is now officialy supported. You can directly open (or drag & drop) [ndjson](http://ndjson.org/) or [jsonl](https://jsonlines.org/) files. You could try this in our demo app - simply open [demo.dbgate.org](https://demo.dbgate.org/) and drag & drop ndjson file to it.

Attention! File is uploaded do DbGate demo server, although nobody else could access this file, please don't try it witgh any sensitive data.

## Multiuser support, improved web app safety
Web (docker/npm) app now supports defining more users, each user could have different permissions. Permissions are set by environment variables, see [docs](https://dbgate.org/docs/env-variables) for details.
