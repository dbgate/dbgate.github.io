The New year 2023 brings also the new version of DbGate - 5.2.0, with huge improvements.

## Oracle support

If you are Oracle user, you will appreciate support for Oracle database. Author of DbGate Oracle plugin is Rinie Kervel, great thanks to him. It is the first version of Oracle support, which is quite difficult, so probably there could be some issues to be fixed, but I will take these issues with top priority.

## User interface improvements
By default, DbGate shows tabs from all databases. Now you could switch to "Locked DB" mode, if you want to focus on one database and hide other tabs.

Also, there is important improvement of search algorithm in all lists (tables, databases, columns). You can now use capital search: eg. filter "PC" searches ProductCategory

## New authentization methods
If you are running DbGate on web server, or event on hosting service, you have new possibilities, how to authenticate users:
* OAuth
* Active directory (Windows authentization)
* Database authorization
See more about [authorization configuration](/features/integration)

## Perspective designer nested join support
If you want to design perspective query with join in MongoDB, it is now possible event from nested object or array. In fact, when you need to define JOIN in MongoDB, in most cases references("foreign key values") are in nested objects, so this feature is a must.

## MongoDB profiler
If you are facing problems with MongoDB performance, now you have a powerful ally - profiler. It catches all queries processed among one database, and shows them in grid. After stop profiling, also there are some basic statistics in charts available.

Profiler feature is prepared for other engines, so in future I will add support for other drivers. (of course, profiling must be supported by underlying database engine)
