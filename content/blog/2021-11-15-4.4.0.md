title: Version 4.4.0 - database compare tool
categories: development
date:   2021-09-20 16:00:00
---

The main highlight of this release in database schema compare tool. It can compare tables with keys, connstraints and indexes, and also views, stored procedures and functions. It works on all supported database engines (MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MariaDB, CockroachDB, Redshift). Database compare tool is super fast, compare to other DB compare tools, as it uses already cached DB models.

## DB Deploy - experimental
In experimental state is the deploy feature - you can deploy changes detected by compare tool to target database. Also you can download DB model into YAML and SQL files and deploy it to database, from DB Gate GUI or from command line. This powerful feature will be more described in standalone article.

## Lookups
You know this feature from spreadsheet software - after clicking of columns, you can quickly filter values. In DbGate, this feature can be used on all columns with foreign keys to lookup referenced tables.
