I am happy to announce new release of DbGate - 6.2.0.

This release brings two important highlights:
* Long awaited Apache Cassandra support (for all editions)
* AI Assistant for query console (for Premium only)

<!--more--> 

## AI Assistant (Premium)
AI assistant in DbGate helps you to create and modify SQL queries. It uses internally LLM gpt-4o-mini from OpenAI. Of course, you could  open ChhatGPT application and ask for the query directly, but DbGate's integration knows underlying DB model - table and column names, so result query will better fit to your database.

As a first step, DbGate asks you for your consent about sending table and columns names to DbGate's AI service - wihtout this AI assistant will now work. We respect your privacy, which is why DbGate will never send any of your database information anywhere without your consent.

After this, AI assistant offers 3 jobs:
- **Text to SQL** - you write query in natural language, DbGate will generate SQL query respecting current database schema
- **Complete SQL on cursor** - DbGate will try to generate next fragment of your query
- **Make changes on your SQL** - in case you have already any query, you could write task in natural language and DbGate will generate new query

## Apache Cassandra support
Apache Cassandra support is for all editions - is part of free and open-source product. We support almost all scenarious as in other databases:
* Data browsing, filtering and edition
* Table editor
* Data import and export

Cassandra has lot of specifics, eg. it doesn't support foreign keys - so master/detail views and lookups will not work.

## Team premium edition improvements
We also made some improvements and bug fixes for team premium edition and administration interface. Also there are new posibilities, how to configure internal database (eg. you use Azure managed identity). Azure managed identity is also supported for regular Azure SQL connections under Team Premium.
