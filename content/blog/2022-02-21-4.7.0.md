The most visible improvement of this version is new look of DbGate window. Especially in dark mode on Windows now it looks much better. There is also posibility to use classic native menu, this option is available in settings dialog.

<!--more--> 

Also the main toolbar was removed, as it included commands, which are used quite rarely. These commands (ge. SQL generator, schema compare) are available from menu tools. There is new contextual toolbar on the bottom of current tab, with commands related to selected tab.

## JSON lines format
JSON lines is text file format, where each line contains JSON serialized row. DbGate uses optional header row, which contains structure of stored data.
DbGate uses this format internally almost everywhere. Now, you have few new posibities, how use this architecture.
 - DbGate native export from Mongo collections is JSONL, which can be directly imported by MongoDB
 - There is new JSONL editor (text editor) with preview ability. You could eg. save your logs as JSONL and make some filtering on it, similarily as data from database
 - Archive files without header line are supported
