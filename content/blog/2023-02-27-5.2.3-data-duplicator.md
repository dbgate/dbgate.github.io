I am glad to announce new release of DbGate - 5.2.3. It brings lot of smaller improvements, and one maybe a bit cryptic feature - data duplicator. Also, as good software should have only useful features, one big feature was completely removed - data sheet editor.

## Better data archive support
Data archive in DbGate is folder with data files in JSON lines (NDJSON) format. This format is heavily used by DbGate, eg. each query result is stored into temporary NDJSON file.

In new version, you could edit NDJSON files (both data and structure) and also define sorting criteria. (filtering was implemented ialready in previous versions)

In former version, editing ofn NDJSON files was possible only with Data sheet editor, which worked only for small data. This was a bit confusing and uncofortable, so this editor is completely removed, now editing works also for large datasets.

## Data duplicator
Data duplicator is quite simple, but very powerful feature. It solves problem, when you have related data in one database (in more related tables), and you want to copy them into another database, with persisting relations. If you could use the same IDs, you could use simpler methods, data duplicator soplves situations, when you must generate new IDs, with preserving relations.

## Mutli column filter
This feature is for very lazy people (or people with lack of time). You could now filter tables, even if you don't know, which column to filter. DbGate simply creates search criteria over all columns for you on background.
Multi-column filtering is also implemented in data perspectives, here it is even more helpful, because you don't see all columns, so settings filter on specific column requires more clicking. In perspectives multi-column filters work also for MongoDB.
