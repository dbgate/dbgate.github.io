This release brings schema editor. You can edit table schema, define primary keys, foreign keys, indexes and unique constraints.  
When alter operation is not directly supported by SQL engine (eg. drop constraint on SQLite), DbGate generates table recreate script. 

Table modifications with recreates are not recomended to run od production databases.
