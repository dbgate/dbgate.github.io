Although 5.1.1 is marked as minor version release, it brings very important change - perspectives (added in last version) have now a new designer. It look similar like query designer, but it has not query designer constraints - as the result is not single flat query, but hiearchical perspective view.

The designer is nice, when using perspectives on database with foreign keys. But it becomes a must, when using on DB without foreign keys, or when using perspective between different databases.

Please use [docs](/docs/perspectives) for further details.
