I’m excited to unveil our latest major release, featuring native DuckDB support, connection import/export, a new data-deployer, and a host of additional enhancements and bug fixes.

## DuckDB support

[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org) is a high-performance analytics database that’s fast, reliable, portable, and easy to use, sporting an advanced SQL dialect that goes far beyond the basics. DbGate now integrates seamlessly with DuckDB: browse and edit tables, run queries, and import or export data—and, just like SQLite, you can open any .duckdb file directly. Only a few features are restricted due to DuckDB’s specialized design.

Thanks [cn00](https://github.com/cn00) for initial pull requets solving DuckDB integration. Although finally we had to make it differently in many ways, it was a good inspiration.

## Import and export connections
You can export any selected connections from your DbGate installation and import them on another computer. This also works across editions: connections can be moved between the Team Premium web edition and the Desktop Premium or Community editions, even though the Team Premium version keeps its connection details in a database rather than local files.

## Documentation
DbGate has also new [documentation](https://docs.dbgate.io/). It is hosted on github in [standalone repository](https://github.com/dbgate/dbgate-docs). Documentation uses [gohuho](https://gohugo.io/) framework with [relearn](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-relearn/) theme

## Improvements from Premium edition
DbGate also brings some improvements for Premium edition in version 6.4.0, you could find them on [dbgate.io](https://dbgate.io/news/2025-04-30-6-4-0-duckdb/)
