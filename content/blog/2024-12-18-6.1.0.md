I am glad to announce new DbGate release, 6.1. It comes relatively shortly after 6.0, but it brings some new key features, lot of fixes and improvements of concepts introduced in 6.0.
<!--more--> 
## Fulltext search in model
This is simple, but very powerful feature, available also in all editions (Community, Premium, Team Premium). 
You could search in procedure/function/view SQL text and in table columns. You could also easily configure, which attributes are searched.

## Tab preview mode
Tab preview mode was one of the key improvements of 6.0. 

What does this mode mean?  When you single-click or select a file in the "Tables, Views, Functions" view, it
is shown in a preview mode and reuses an existing tab (preview tab). This is useful if you are quickly browsing
tables and don't want every visited table to have its own tab. When you start editing the table or use double-click
to open the table from the "Tables" view, a new tab is dedicated to that table.

Version 6.1 brings configuration, you could disable this mode entirely, or disable opening detail, when using keyboard navigation. You could also configure default actions for connection and database.

There is important usability change from 6.0, now you could again choose connection/database with single-click and this is default behaviour. Also when default database is configured, it is choosed after connecting to server.

## Oracle support improved
Oracle support was added to DbGate integration tests, so Oracle support is now at the same level as support of other databases. Some of newly added Oracle features includes:
* Support for procedures and functions
* Fixed displaying CLOB and NCLOB fields
* Import data into Oracle fixed
* Support for rename table, view, procedure, function, column
* Table editor (ALTER TABLE) - added missing implementations
* Support for Data Duplicator
