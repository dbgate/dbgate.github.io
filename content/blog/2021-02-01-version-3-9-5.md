Version 3.9.5 is out. It contains many bug fixes and UI improvements. The biggest new feature is form view on table data.

## Form view
Form view is handy, when viewing and editing table with many columns. You can switch between normal table and and form view any time. Filters and expanded columns are persistent among views. You can also expand foreign key references in form views.

## Open files from disk
DbGate supports saving SQL files to internal storage, as this approach works in web application in the same way, as in electron app. From this version, in electron app, you can also load and save SQL files from disk. Also opening files by drag & drop is supported.

## Expandable table list
This is small but useful improvement. You can expand table to see its columns directly in left widget.
