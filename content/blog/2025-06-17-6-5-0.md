After almost 2 months, I could announce the new major release of DbGate - 6.5.0, with important changes. We introduced DbGate Cloud, online storage of your connections and SQL scripts. DbGate cloud is available for both Community and premium edition, for cCommunity edition there are some limitations.

## DbGate Cloud

DbGate Cloud consists of two parts - private online storage and public knowledge base.

### Public knowledge base
You need to see table or index sizes in your database, analyse deadlocks or use sample databases? You could find right script for this task in DbGate public knowledge base. This collection of SQL scripts is quickly accessible in DbGate. The source if this collection is [dbgate-knowledge-base](https://github.com/dbgate/dbgate-knowledge-base) GitHub repository. Feel free to extend this repository with your own favorite scripts, pull requests are welcome.

Knowledge base is accessible also for Community editions, only with one exception - charts, which are supported only in Premium.

### Private cloud
Private cloud is available after sign-in. You could use Gmail, GitHub or e-mail with magic link sing-in method, no registration needed. DbGate private cloud in Community edition is limited to 5 connections and 5 SQL files in your private folder.

Premium edition offers unlimited storage and support for shared folders.

## Firebird support
We added support of new database engine - [Firebird](https://www.firebirdsql.org/). Firebird is lightweight and open-source SQL database, used mainly in traditional environments (it's ancestor is Embarcadero/Borland Interbase). 

There is also [opened PR](https://github.com/dbgate/dbgate/pull/1131) for DB2 support (thanks [Genrges Bernaba](https://github.com/GergesBernaba1) for this effort), so you could expect DB2 support soon.

## SQL front matter
We also introduced concept of SQL front matter (this idea appeared first in Jekyll static site generator). SQL front matter are meta-data about SQL script stored in the begining of SQL script. There is eg. posibility to automatic execution of the script when opening. You could read more about SQL front matter in [documentation](https://docs.dbgate.io/sql-front-matter).
