## Installation process
Installation on Azure is very straighforward, it is almost single-click process. 

We recommend virtual machines with 2 GB RAM.

After installation, you have to set admin password, then you could administer connections, users, roles and grant permissions.

## Subscription and licensing
DbGate Azure can be subscribed to through the Azure Marketplace, with pricing based on the number of processor of the chosen virtual machine. 

A 30-day free trial gives you access to all DbGate features. After the trial, billing follows Azure pricing plan according to the selected instance size. No additional licensing is required, as all payments are handled through the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/sprinxsystemsas1582034211947.dbgate_azure_vm?tab=Overview) subscription.

## DbGate Azure updates
DbGate Azure has it's special build and runs directly virtual server (there is no additional virtualization layer like docker). There is auto-upgrade functionality - after start, the container makes request for the newest build and if found, it replaces old version. You don't have do upgrade manually. 

If you create manually new virtual machine with new version, it will have its new database (internal MySQL database is part of virtual machine), so there is no simple way of moving connections and users to new virtual machine.
