## Subscription and licensing
DbGate AWS can be subscribed to through the AWS Marketplace, with pricing based on the size of the chosen instance. Larger instances support more concurrent users.

A 30-day free trial gives you access to all DbGate features. After the trial, billing follows AWSâ€™s pricing plan according to the selected instance size. No additional licensing is required, as all payments are handled through the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-glw7okfnhf4cy) subscription.

## DbGate AWS updates
DbGate AWS has it's special build and runs directly virtual server in EC2 (there is no additional virtualization layer like docker). There is auto-upgrade functionality - after start, the container makes request for the newest build and if found, it replaces old version. You don't have do upgrade manually. 

If you create manually new EC2 container with new version, it will have its new database (internal MySQL database is part of container), so there is no simple way of moving connections and users to new EC2 container.
