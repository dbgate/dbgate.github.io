I started to develop DbGate at the end of 2019. Main reason was, that I switched from Windows to Linux, where it was quite hard to find any usable database tool.

# DbGate goals

- Free and opensource
- Simple, but powerful. One toolbar, no milions of icons without description. Heavy use of context menu
- Runs everywhere - Windows, Linux, Mac, web browser, maybe also mobile web in future
- Stable and robust. Critical error in one database driver must not influence stability of the app
- Prepared for big databases - never load full table or query result into memory, use streams everywhere
- Scriptable, using dbgate [nodejs packages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dbgate-api)

# About author

My name is [Jan Prochazka](https://github.com/janproch/), I live in Czech Republic. I was specialized to realtime computation software, which used heavy Miccrosoft SQL Server. Now I work mainly with JavaScript and modern techology stack around it. I am also creating music software for pianists, [PianoHub](https://pianohub.cloud).

# Motivation
I started to create database manager tools in 2010. All my tools developed in past were under commercial license.

My first DB admin tool was DatAdmin.

The second generation was DbMouse, which was designed only to work only with MS SQL Server. It comes with idea of open-source db engine (called DbShell) implementing low-level operations on DB, on the DbShell gear was built GUI under classical commercial license. It was also rebranded as SQL database studio, it had slighly better sales performance than DbMouse, but it was not enough.

# DbGate Premium
Primary reason, why I started to develop DbGate, is to survive my know-how about database tools, and substantialize into modern, usable and open-source database tool.
As DbGate growed into mature product, there were some users requesting commercial support and enterprise features. I joined with [Sprinx systems](https://sprinx.com/) company, so that we could offer professional [DbGate Premium](https://dbgate.eu) product on top on opensource DbGate.
