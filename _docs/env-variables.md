## Web & permission configuration
* WEB_ROOT - if you need to run DbGate in virtual subdirectory (eg. for value /dbadmin , dbgate will be accessible on localhost:3000/dbadmin )
* LOGIN , PASSWORD - credentials for accessing web app
* PERMISSIONS - list of comma separated permissions. See also permission list below
* SHELL_CONNECTION - if true or 1, connections can be defined in shell scripts. Otherwise, only preconfigured connections are allowed. By default, this is not allowed for security reasons.
* SHELL_SCRIPTING - if true or 1, custom JavaScript shell scripts are allowed. By default, this is not allowed for security reasons.
* *LOGINS - comma delimited list of aditional logins - deprecated*
* LOGIN_PASSWORD_[login] - password for specified login
* LOGIN_PERMISSIONS_[login] - list of comma separated permissions for given login. See also permission list below
* TOKEN_LIFETIME - lifetime of access token. After this time, logged user will be redirected to login page. Default is 1d (means 1 day). Possible are values like 3h (3 hours), 10m (10 minutes), 2d (2 days)
* SINGLE_CONNECTION - connection id. If defined, only this connection will be available (must be used with SINGLE_DATABASE)
* SINGLE_DATABASE - database name, only this database will be available. (must be used with SINGLE_CONNECTION)
* BASIC_AUTH - if true or 1 , basic authentization of both web and API is used. Otherwise, login form and JWT token base API authentization is used. Basic authentization cannot be used for OAuth authentization.

## Logging configuration
* LOG_LEVEL - all messages with this log level or bigger will be logged. One of values trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal. Default is info
* FILE_LOG_LEVEL - log level for logging into log file. For file logging, this has bigger priority than LOG_LEVEL
* CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL - log level for logging into log file. For console logging, this has bigger priority than LOG_LEVEL

## OAuth configuration (web version only)

* OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET - client secret
* OAUTH_LOGIN_FIELD - field name from payload, which holds login name. For availabe fields, you could inspect dbgate log, payload sent from OAuth provider are logged to console.

* OAUTH_ALLOWED_LOGINS - comma separator login names, which will be allowed to login. If not specified, all logins will be allowed to use DbGate app.
* OAUTH_SCOPE - scope, which is sent to OAuth authorize and token endpoint
