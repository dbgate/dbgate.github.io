I am glad to announce new release of DbGate - 5.5.0. There is a huge set of improvements coming with this release, but the main hightlight is long-awaited support of ClickHouse database engine.

[ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/) is fast OLAP open-source database. DbGate has wide support of clickhouse features, you could create and change tables, with ability of definiting clickhouse specific features like sorting keys or table engines. As for other supported databases, you can import and export data, or do data editing job (which, by the way, is a bit more tricky than for traditional SQL databases)

The second big improvement is redesign of import/export system. Former full-screen modal dialog was used, this is now replaced with tab, which has some benefits, you could easily re-run import/export after checking affected data, you could even save export/import job for later.

Also there is new import from JSON files, which could also import from URL. This is very handy for importing result of APIs into your databases.
