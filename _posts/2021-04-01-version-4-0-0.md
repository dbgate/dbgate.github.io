Version 4.0.0 is out. The biggest change is change of UI framework. We have got rid of React and replaced it with excellent [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) framework. This change leads to faster UI, with smaller memory consumption. Also it allows to implement Command palette, which would bery very defficult with React.

## SQL Generator
SQL Generator allows to create SQL scripts from database. It has following options:
* Tables
  * Create (with or without foreign keys)
  * Drop (if exists)
  * Create/Drop references foreign keys
  * Insert (options: skip autoincrement, omit NULL values, disable constraints)
  * Truncate
* Views, stored procedures, functions
  * Create
  * Drop
You can combine options from all DB objects and generate customized SQL script containing database structure and data

## Command palette
DbGate commands are now organized in Command Palette (press F1 to see it). It contains all currenctly available commands, with keyboard shortcut.
