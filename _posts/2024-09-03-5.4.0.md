I'm excited to announce the new release of DbGate, version 5.4.0! After a long wait, we're introducing support for a new database engine: Azure CosmosDB. CosmosDB is a cloud-based, document-oriented database from Microsoft, and its support is available exclusively in the Premium edition.

One of the major features in the [Premium edition](https://dbgate.org/pricing/) is the new [user administration](https://dbgate.org/docs/admin.html) functionality, which includes role-based permissions, role-specific connections, and multiple login methods. You can explore these new features with a 30-day free trial.

We've also made significant improvements to MongoDB support. All basic MongoDB types are now natively supported, and more specific data types are available via generic EJSON support. The MongoDB support has been partially rewritten to provide DbGate with enhanced NoSQL capabilities, leading to substantial improvements in features like filtering and data editing.
