We are happy to announce new major release, 6.0. The new version brings significant usability changes and more intuitive workflows.

## UX 6.0
We were working hard to make DbGate even more easy to use.

You could now use keyboard to navigate between tables and connections. We have implemented <strong>tab preview mode<strong> - tabs with <i>headers in italics</i> are used as preview, when you choose another table/view/procedure/connection, preview tab is reused, so you  don't end with many opened tabs, if you need only quick check something.

There are also singificant improvement in connection/database quick search. Eg. when you have database "Chinook" under connection named "My server", when you type "My chin", this database is correctly filtered.

## Compare & synchronize models (Premium)

We added lot of new options to compare database models tool:
<ul>
    <li>Ingore case or schemae name</li>
    <li>Disable drop tables/columns/views. When the object is missing, you could ignore this (the safest variant) or mark object as deleted (eg. rename deleted column "Fax" to "_deleted_Fax")</li>
    <li>Ignore foreign key actions</li>
    <li>Ignore data types</li>
</ul>

Compare model tool is now exclusively in Premium and Team Premium editions.

## API documnetation
Unlike other database administration tools, DbGate has API for majority of lower-level operations. If you have some export/import, you could export the job as JavaScript file and run with Nodejs, independently on DbGate. You could also enhance or generalize this generated script, to get requested results. We have added generated documentation for supported operations. Now it contains only basic export/import operations, but it will grow soon.
