title: Version 5.1.3 - Query editor improvements
categories: development

This version brings small, but important improvements of SQL editor usability.

## Execute query part

DbGate supports executing single SQL statements from long SQL scripts. Former there was only command "Execute current", which executes command under cursor. With new version, commands could be directly executing by clicking "Play" button in gutter area.

## Error reporting

Query errors are now displayed directly in editor, in similar way, as you are used to from other IDEs.

## Cell data editing

If table cell data contains multiple lines of data, now modal window is opened. You you have JSON data in you tables, you could use JSON formatter and syntax highlighting, when cediting cell values.
